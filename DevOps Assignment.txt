DevOps Assignment
📌 Overview
In this assignment, candidates will demonstrate end-to-end DevOps skills by running, containerizing, testing, deploying, and operating a simple two-tier web application (Python backend + Next.js frontend).
The application must be deployed on at least TWO cloud platforms out of:
* AWS
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Microsoft Azue
All infrastructure and workflows must be automated using Git, Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Terraform, and must include monitoring, security, and load balancing.
You can find the code base to be hosted here: Codebase

🔍 Assignment Tasks
1️⃣ Version Control Expectations
Candidates must:
      * Use the provided repository as the starting point
      * Maintain the original project structure and extend it as needed
      * Follow a clear branching strategy, for example:
      * main – production-ready code
      * develop – integration branch
      * feature/* – feature or task branches
      * Use Pull Requests to merge changes into develop and main
      * Write clear, meaningful commit messages
      * Avoid pushing all changes directly to main
❌ Disallowed Practices
      * Submitting code as a ZIP file
      * Uploading screenshots instead of Git history
      * Single-commit repositories with no meaningful history
      * Replacing the repository entirely instead of extending it

2️⃣ Run & Containerize
Backend
         * Simple REST API:
         * /health
         * /api/message
         * Write at least 2 unit tests
         * Dockerize using a multi-stage Dockerfile
         * Follow container best practices:
         * Small image size
         * Non-root user
         * Environment-based config
Frontend
         * Next.js UI that calls backend APIs
         * Write at least 2 end-to-end tests (Jest / Cypress / Playwright)
         * Dockerize using a multi-stage Dockerfile
3️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline
Configure CI/CD (GitHub Actions preferred):
On every push to develop:
         * Checkout code
         * Run backend tests
         * Run frontend tests
         * Build Docker images
         * Tag images using Git SHA
         * Push images to container registries:
         * AWS ECR / GCP Artifact Registry / Azure ACR
On merge to main:
         * Automatically deploy to at least 2 cloud platforms
         * Zero manual steps post-merge

4️⃣ Infrastructure as Code (Multi-Cloud)
Candidates must deploy to any TWO of the following:
☁️ AWS (Example)

            * IAM roles with least privilege
            * Secrets Manager
☁️ GCP (Example)
            * GKE or Cloud Run
            * VPC networking
            * IAM service accounts
            * Secret Manager
☁️ Azure (Example)
            * Azure Container Apps or AKS
            * VNet + NSGs
            * Managed identities
            * Azure Key Vault
Requirements
            * All infrastructure must be provisioned using Terraform
            * Reusable and modular Terraform structure preferred
            * No manual resource creation

5️⃣ Monitoring & Alerting
For each deployed cloud platform:
               * Configure monitoring dashboards showing:
               * CPU usage
               * Memory usage
               * Request count / latency
               * Create at least one alert:
               * Example: CPU > 70% for 5 minutes
               * Alert must notify via:
               * Email / Slack / equivalent
6️⃣ Security & IAM
               * Use least-privilege IAM roles / service accounts

               * Store secrets in:

                  * AWS Secrets Manager

                  * GCP Secret Manager

                        * CI logs

                           * Document:

                              * Ingress / egress rules

                              * Public vs private services


7️⃣ Load Balancing & Resiliency
                                 * Run a minimum of 2 container instances per service
                                 * Demonstrate:
                                 * Traffic distribution via Load Balancer
                                 * One instance being stopped or deregistered
                                 * Application remains available (no downtime)
